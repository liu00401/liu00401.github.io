Introduction

Challenges faced during development: 
Created a framework to start with is kind of hard for me. 
Firstly, I found a framework which is based on bootstrap, and can provide good foundation, but it is too completed to me to fully understand. 
After doing some research, I find https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/ can provide a reset stylesheet to reduce browser inconsistencies in things like default line heights, margins and font sizes of headings, and so on. So I use that as the starting point for the portfolio.
		
Knowledge learned by creating the web portfolio:
By doing the project, I become more familiar with structure of the web site, how different web technologies are bound, and how to build web site, from understanding requirement, UX/UI design, to implementation and test.
